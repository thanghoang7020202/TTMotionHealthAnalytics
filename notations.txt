! there are 2 types of features in the dataset:
swing features:
1) ax_mean, ay_mean, az_mean, gx_mean, gy_mean, gz_mean
- ax_var, ay_var, az_var, gx_var, gy_var, gz_var
- ax_rms, ay_rms, az_rms, gx_rms, gy_rms, gz_rms
18 total

2) a_max, a_mean, a_min, g_max, g_mean, g_min, 
- a_skewn, g_skewn, a_kurt, g_kurt
10 total

3) from FFT:
- a_fft, g_fft, a_psdx, g_psdx
- a_entropy, g_entropy
6 total

personal features:
- gender, age, height, weight, handedness, holdRacketHanded, playYears

what had been done in arXiv:2306.17550v1:
- gender prediction
- age prediction
- mode prediction (testmod swing in the air, ull power stroke, and stable hitting)
- Racket-holding hand Prediction (holdRacketHanded) (right or left hand)
- Experience in Years Prediction (playYears)

new:
- height classification:
    + input xs:
        - ax_mean, ay_mean, az_mean, gx_mean, gy_mean, gz_mean
        - ax_var, ay_var, az_var, gx_var, gy_var, gz_var
        - ax_rms, ay_rms, az_rms, gx_rms, gy_rms, gz_rms
        - a_max, a_mean, a_min, g_max, g_mean, g_min
        - a_skewn, g_skewn, a_kurt, g_kurt
        - a_entropy, g_entropy
    + output: different height classes (1:short, 2: medium, 3: tall)
- height prediction (regression)
- weight prediction
(health care? or fitness?)
-health of player over time?
